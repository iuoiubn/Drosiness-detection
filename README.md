DRIVER DROWSINESS DETECTION

Abstract:
There has been a very large increase in road accident due to drowsiness of driver while driving
which leads to enormous fatal accidents. The driver loses his control when he falls sleep which
leads to accident. This is because when the driver is not able to control his vehicle at very high
speed on the road. This project can generate a model which can prevent such accidents. Eye
blink sensor is used for the safety system of driver. Whenever Eye blink sensor is happened then
buzzer will activate and Red will glow.

INTRODUCTION

In modern-times, owing to hectic schedules it becomes very difficult to remain active all the
time. Imagine a situation where a person is driving home from work, dead tired after facing all
the challenges of the day. His hands are on the wheel and foot on the pedal but suddenly he starts
feeling drowsy, his eyes start shutting and his vision blurs and before he knows it, he’s asleep.
Falling asleep on the wheel can lead to serious consequences, there may be accidents and people
may even lose their lives. This situation is much more common then we notice and hence, it is
very important to counter this problem. So to address this issue, we have come up with a Driver
Anti-sleep Device. This system alerts the user if he/she falls asleep at the wheel thereby,
avoiding accidents and saving lives. 

Embedded system implementation

Introduction:
An embedded system is one kind of a computer system mainly designed to
perform several tasks like to access, process, and store and also control the data in various
electronics-based systems.  Embedded systems are a combination of hardware and software
where software is usually known as firmware that is embedded into the hardware. One of its
most important characteristics of these systems is, it gives the o/p within the time limits.
Embedded systems support to make the work more perfect and convenient. So, we frequently use
embedded systems in simple and complex devices too. The applications of embedded systems

mainly involve in our real life for several devices like microwave, calculators, TV remote
control, home security and neighborhood traffic control systems, etc.
